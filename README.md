# consent-task

# About

This is a task designed for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container.

# Purpose

Display study information and request informed consent from participant.  You could also use this task for study debrief by including it in a container twice ([see Examples](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/generate#detailed-start)) under the names `consent` and `debrief`.  When using this task in an Experiment Factory container, URLs for each participant can be configured using [Participant Variables](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/usage).  So you could use variables to specify different consent and debrief URLs for each of your experimental conditions.
